        <p align=left>Morgan Jones was born in Columbia, South Carolina but has traveled all over the world due to her parents being in the military. She has lived in places like Japan, California, Florida, and many other locations. Being able to travel throughout her life has taught her to become well diverse, cultured, and open to new experiences.</p>
        <p align=left>Morgan has attended many schools throughout her childhood. However, she graduated in Tampa, Florida at H.B. Plant High School. At her graduation, Morgan was one of the top 100 students with honors of a class of 600. From there, she moved on to begin her path to a college degree.</p>
        <p align=left>After high school, she attended Saint Leo University for her freshman and sophomore year of college. She then decided to go further down south of Florida and transfer to the University of Miami. Currently, Morgan is majoring in Broadcast Journalism and minoring in Public Relations. </p>
        <p align=left>One day, Morgan hopes to be an anchor in the entertainment business, such as E! News or on BET. If that doesn't work out, Morgan hopes to find a career with being a celebrity publicist.</p>
        <p align=left>In her free time, she likes to take spontaneous pictures of different events in her life, as well as spending time with family and friends.</p>
